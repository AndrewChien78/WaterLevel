This notebook shows how River Water Level Data from Edmonton Canada can be filtered.
Google Style Guide for R is adopted for this document.

Dataset Source: https://data.edmonton.ca/dataset/Water-Levels-and-Flows/cnsu-iagr

## Set Global variables for this program
```{r Variable settings}
input.datafile <- "data/Water_Levels_and_Flows.csv"
station.name <- "atimCreek"
station.id <- "05EA012"
# Edmonton "05DF001" Edmonton not used as it has two records with identical time stamp
setwd(working.directory)
```

## Data Import
Read the large dataset into R Environment. Note: The loading will take a minute or two as the file is 500MB in size.
```{r}
water.dataset<- read.csv(input.datafile)
```
Use the command below to check the loaded data.
```{r}
View(water.dataset)
```
## Data Filtering
Filter and store the selected River Water Level Station data(e.g. AtimCreek) into a dataset stationData. 

```{r}
station.data <- filter(water.dataset, Station.Number == station.id)
```
Optional: Next we can choose to store the dataset in the CSV format using the write.csv function. The CSV format allows the dataset to be used for Python programs. Here are the commands for saving the if we want to store this dataset to disk, key in the 
following command:

We run the rm command to remove the large dataset from memory.
```{r}
write.csv(station.name, file=paste(f_name,".csv", sep="") 
          # "C:/Users/andre/Desktop/WaterLevel/atimCreek.csv")
rm(water.dataset)
```
The commands below select only the Date and Time and Water level columns out of the AtimCreek River dataset. 
```{r}
atimCreek_WL <- select(atimCreek, Date.and.Time, Water.Level..m.)

```
## Data Sorting
Next we need to sort the rows according to date and time to get the rows in order for us to convert atimCreek into a time series. Use the POSIXct function to do so as our column has both date and time. atimCreek_WL_Sort is the new dataset that has been sorted according to time.
```
atimCreek_WL_Sort <- atimCreek_WL[order(as.POSIXct(atimCreek_WL$Date.and.Time, format="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")),]
write.csv(atimCreek_WL_Sort, "C:/Users/andre/Desktop/WaterLevel/atimCreek_WL_Sort.csv")
```
## Data Cleaning
After plotting the atimCreek Water Level, I noticed that there are some "zero" or invalid values. Note:

|![AtimCreek Water Level before sorting and cleaning](C:/Users/andre/Desktop/WaterLevel/atimCreek_WL_Sort_Dirty.png)|
|:--:|
| *AtimCreek Water Level before sorting and cleaning*|

These values needs to be cleaned up and these samples removed. After cleaning, 98 samples with -1.000 water level was removed.
```
atimCreek_WL_Clean <- filter(atimCreek_WL_Sort, Water.Level..m. > 0 )
```
Next we can convert the AtimCreek Water Levels into a time series for time series analysis in R. We will need select only the datetime sorted Water.Level..m. column
```
atimCreek_Series <- select(atimCreek_WL_Clean, Water.Level..m.)
write.csv(atimCreek_Series, "C:/Users/andre/Desktop/WaterLevel/atimCreek_Series.csv")
```
For the conversion from the vector into a time series object we use the ts() function. The ts() function requires that the frequency and start year is specified. The start date is found at the first row of the atimCreek_WL_Sort.csv file. We will take that value and use that as a begintime value. 
```
begintime <- 


```
atimCreek_ts <-ts(atimCreek_Series, frequency = 12*24*365, start=c(2016.7883652))
plot.ts(atimCreek_ts)
```
