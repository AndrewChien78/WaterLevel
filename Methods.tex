\section{Paper Review}
	The 1st paper review here is the paper by \cite{Nguyen2015Oct}. This conference paper cited the suitability of SVR as a way to predict water levels in the Mekong River.
	
	The problem was defined as follows:
	Forecast 5-lead-day water levels at Thakhek station on Mekong river.
	
	The Relationship between input and output features:\\

		\(H_{Thakhek}(t + 5) = f(H_{Thakhek}(t),H_{Thakhek}(t − 1),H_{Thakhek}(t − 2),H_{up}(t),H_{up}(t − 1),H_{up}(t − 2)).\)\\	
	
	where the current and 2 previous days water level of Thakhek station is used and current and 2 previous days water level is used to of Nongkhai station is used. Nongkhai is the 300km upstream station of Mekong River.\\
	
	Machine Learning Models used:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LASSO
		\item Random Forests
		\item Support Vector Regression
	\end{itemize}
